This is a toy application created with Ruby on Rails following the curriculum of [The Odin Project](https://theodingproject.com). Go to [project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/building-advanced-forms?ref=lnav). Below, I explain briefly how the app flows. You can also view it [live on Heroku](https://desolate-badlands-69332.herokuapp.com/).
